# EDA2_Assignment 

 Identify and analyze demographics with varying levels of thyroid cancer risk using a data-driven approach.It encompasses a wide range of demographic, environmental, and medical attributes, making it suitable for various analytical and predictive modeling tasks.

- In this dataset There are  17 columns and 212691 rows.
- I used pandas , matplotlib and seaborn  library for Data Cleaning: pandas provides tools to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.
  Data Transformation: With functions like groupby(), pivot_table(), and merge(), pandas facilitates complex data transformations.

üîç Feature Descriptions

1. Demographics
Age: Numerical value representing the patient's age
Gender: Categorical variable (e.g., Male, Female)
Country: Country of residence
Ethnicity: Ethnic background of the patient

2. Medical Indicators
TSH_Level (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone): Hormone level influencing thyroid activity
T3_Level: Triiodothyronine hormone level
T4_Level: Thyroxine hormone level
Nodule Size: Size of thyroid nodules detected

3. Risk Factors
Family History: Presence of thyroid cancer in family history
Radiation Exposure: Exposure to radiation, a known risk factor
Iodine Deficiency: Lack of iodine in diet
Smoking: Smoking habits
Obesity: Body mass index indicating obesity
Diabetes: Presence of diabetes

4. Outcome Variables
Thyroid Cancer Risk: Categorized as Low, Medium, or High
Diagnosis: Final diagnosis indicating Benign or Malignant


üìà Key Insights
Demographic Impact: Age and gender significantly influence thyroid cancer risk, with older individuals and females showing higher probabilities.
Geographical Variations: Certain countries and ethnicities exhibit higher prevalence rates, potentially due to genetic and environmental factors.
Medical Correlations: Elevated TSH levels and larger nodule sizes are associated with increased cancer risk.
Lifestyle Factors: Smoking and obesity are notable contributors to heightened risk levels.

üß† Potential Applications
Risk Stratification: Classifying patients into different risk categories to prioritize medical interventions.
Personalized Medicine: Tailoring treatment plans based on individual risk profiles.
Public Health Policy: Informing strategies to mitigate risk factors prevalent in specific demographics or regions.
Educational Tools: Serving as a resource for teaching data analysis and machine learning techniques in healthcare contexts.
