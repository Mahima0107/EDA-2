 Identify and analyze demographics with varying levels of thyroid cancer risk using a data-driven approach

- In this dataset There are  17 columns and 212690 rows.
- I used pandas , matplotlib and seaborn  library for Data Cleaning: pandas provides tools to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries.
  Data Transformation: With functions like groupby(), pivot_table(), and merge(), pandas facilitates complex data transformations.

4. Outcome Variables
Thyroid Cancer Risk: Categorized as Low, Medium, or High
Diagnosis: Final diagnosis indicating Benign or Malignant


üìà Key Insights
Demographic Impact: Age and gender significantly influence thyroid cancer risk, with older individuals and females showing higher probabilities.
Geographical Variations: Certain countries and ethnicities exhibit higher prevalence rates, potentially due to genetic and environmental factors.
Medical Correlations: Elevated TSH levels and larger nodule sizes are associated with increased cancer risk.
Lifestyle Factors: Smoking and obesity are notable contributors to heightened risk levels.

üß† Potential Applications
Machine Learning Models: Develop predictive models to assess individual risk levels based on input features.
Healthcare Analytics: Inform public health strategies by identifying high-risk demographics and regions.
Clinical Decision Support: Assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.
Educational Tools: Create interactive dashboards for patient education and awareness campaigns.
